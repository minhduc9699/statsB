## Authentication & Authorization

### Ticket 1: Implement User Registration
Description: Develop a user registration system allowing new users to create accounts using an email and password.
Acceptance Criteria:
Users can sign up via a registration form on the frontend.
Passwords are securely hashed before storage in MongoDB.
Users receive a confirmation email after registration.
Registered users can log in successfully with their credentials.

### Ticket 2: Implement User Login
Description: Create a login system for users to authenticate with their email and password.
Acceptance Criteria:
Users can log in using a frontend login form.
Successful login returns an authentication token (e.g., JWT).
Failed login attempts display appropriate error messages (e.g., "Invalid credentials").

### Ticket 3: Set Up Role-Based Access Control
Description: Define user roles (e.g., player, coach, admin) and implement permission checks for feature access.
Acceptance Criteria:
Roles are assigned to users during registration or by admins.
API endpoints enforce role-based permissions (e.g., coaches can manage teams, players can view stats).
Frontend dynamically shows/hides features based on user role.

### Ticket 4: Develop Team Management System (Frontend Only, Mock Data)

**Description:**  
Implement the frontend logic and UI for team management. All data will be mocked on the client side (no backend integration). There will be exactly 2 teams, each with an unlimited roster, but only 5 players per team can be marked as "in the game" at any time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Coaches can create and edit team details (e.g., name, description) via UI forms.
- Each team can have an unlimited number of players in its roster (add/remove players via UI).
- Coaches can assign team roles (e.g., captain) to players.
- For each team, coaches can select up to 5 players as "active/in the game" at any time (UI enforces this limit).
- All features use mock data (no backend/API calls).
- UI displays both teams and their rosters, with a clear distinction between "in the game" and bench players.
- All changes are reflected immediately in the UI state (no persistence required).
- Use clear, intuitive UI/UX patterns for adding/removing players, editing team info, and toggling player status.
- Player selection in event creation must be updated to only allow choosing from the 5 "in the game" players for each team.

### Ticket 5: Refactor Main App UI to Multiple Pages
Description: Split the main application UI into multiple pages using a routing solution (e.g., React Router). Move the Dashboard and Export components to a dedicated page, and ensure smooth navigation between pages.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Main navigation allows switching between at least two pages: Main (VideoPlayer, TaggingInterface, etc.) and Dashboard/Export.
- Dashboard and Export components are only visible on their dedicated page.
- Other main features remain accessible on their respective pages.
- Navigation is intuitive and state is preserved as needed when switching pages.

### Ticket 6: Create Player Profile Management
Description: Allow players to view and edit their profiles, including personal details and stats.
Acceptance Criteria:
Players can update profile info (e.g., name, position, bio) via a frontend interface.
Profile pages display tracked stats (e.g., points, assists).
Access is restricted to authenticated users with appropriate permissions.

## Data Infrastructure

### Ticket 6: Set Up MongoDB Database
Description: Install and configure MongoDB, and design the initial database schema for the platform.
Acceptance Criteria:
MongoDB instance is running and accessible.
Schema supports key entities: users, teams, players, and stats.
Application backend (Node.js/Express) connects to the database successfully.

### Ticket 7: Implement Redis Caching
Description: Set up Redis to cache frequently accessed data for performance optimization.
Acceptance Criteria:
Redis server is installed and configured.
Caching is implemented for key data (e.g., user sessions, player stats).
Cached data retrieval improves response times (e.g., < 500ms).

### Ticket 8: Configure AWS S3 for File Storage
Description: Set up an AWS S3 bucket to store files such as player photos and videos.
Acceptance Criteria:
S3 bucket is created with secure permissions.
File upload functionality is integrated into the backend.
Users can upload and retrieve files (e.g., profile pictures, videos) via the frontend.

### Ticket 9: Establish Data Backup System
Description: Implement a system for regular backups of the MongoDB database to prevent data loss.
Acceptance Criteria:
Automated daily backups are scheduled (e.g., using MongoDB tools or AWS).
Backups are stored securely and can be restored successfully.
Backup process is documented for team reference.

## Core Features

### Ticket 10: Develop Player Profiles with Stat Tracking
Description: Create player profile pages that display individual statistics and allow stat updates.
Acceptance Criteria:
Profile pages show player info and stats (e.g., points, rebounds) using Chart.js for visualization.
Coaches or admins can input/update stats via a frontend interface.
Stats are stored in MongoDB and reflected in real-time on profiles.

### Ticket 11: Implement Basic Team Management
Description: Enable team creation and basic management features, including roster updates.
Acceptance Criteria:
Coaches can create/edit teams (e.g., name, logo) via the frontend.
Rosters can be managed (add/remove players) with real-time updates.
Team pages display current roster and basic team stats.

### Ticket 12: Integrate Video Functionality
Description: Enhance video integration to allow uploads or embedding for event tagging, building on the current implementation.
Acceptance Criteria:
Users can upload videos to S3 via the frontend.
Videos can be embedded from external platforms (e.g., YouTube) using Video.js.
Basic event tagging (e.g., timestamps for key plays) is functional.

### Ticket 13: Set Up Basic Subscription System
Description: Implement subscription plans (Individual: $9.99/month, Team: $49.99/month, League: $99.99/month) with payment processing.
Acceptance Criteria:
Users can select a subscription plan via the frontend.
Payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) is integrated for secure transactions.
Subscription status is stored in MongoDB and restricts/enables feature access accordingly.

## Additional Technical Tasks

### Ticket 14: Write Unit Tests for Authentication
Description: Ensure the authentication system (registration, login, roles) is reliable through unit testing.
Acceptance Criteria:
Tests cover registration, login, and role-based access control.
Tests pass for various scenarios (e.g., invalid inputs, unauthorized access).
Test coverage exceeds 80% for authentication code.

### Ticket 15: Create API Documentation
Description: Document all API endpoints to support development and future integrations.
Acceptance Criteria:
Documentation (e.g., using Swagger) includes all endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication details.
Docs are accessible to the team and updated as endpoints evolve.

### Ticket 16: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline
Description: Automate testing and deployment to streamline development workflows.
Acceptance Criteria:
CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) is configured.
Automated tests run on each code push.
Successful builds deploy to staging/production environments.

### Ticket 17: Implement Data Encryption
Description: Secure sensitive data in transit and at rest as per the roadmap’s security requirements.
Acceptance Criteria:
HTTPS is enforced for all API communications.
Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info) is encrypted in MongoDB.
Encryption keys are managed securely (e.g., AWS KMS).
Ticket 18: Conduct Security Audit
Description: Perform a security review to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
Acceptance Criteria:
Audit uses automated tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) and manual checks.
Identified issues are documented and resolved.
Application adheres to security best practices (e.g., GDPR compliance).
Notes for the Development Team
Dependencies: Prioritize foundational tasks (e.g., MongoDB setup, authentication) as they are prerequisites for other features.
Technical Stack: Use Node.js/Express (backend), React with TypeScript (frontend), MongoDB, Redis, and AWS services as specified.
Timeline: Complete Phase 1 within 3 months, aligning with the roadmap’s schedule.
Collaboration: Coordinate with business/marketing teams to ensure features (e.g., subscriptions, team management) meet business goals like the pricing model and target audience (basketball camps/clinics).
